Unzip and Delete ZIP Files
Description:
The Unzip and Delete ZIP Files application is a Tkinter-based GUI tool that allows users to extract ZIP files from a selected directory and delete them after successful extraction. The application handles extraction in a separate thread, includes timeout management, and provides real-time feedback on the process through a scrolling text widget.

Features:

*Folder Selection: Users can select a folder containing ZIP files for extraction.

*Unzip with Timeout: Each ZIP file is extracted with a configurable timeout, allowing the application to skip problematic files.

*Delete ZIP Files: Successfully unzipped files are automatically deleted from the directory.

*Real-Time Feedback: The application updates the user on the progress, including any errors or skipped files.

*Threading Support: Uses threading to ensure the GUI remains responsive during the extraction process.

Requirements:

*Python 3.x

*Tkinter for the GUI (comes pre-installed with standard Python distributions)

Usage:
1)Run the application by executing the script:

python unzip_and_delete.py

2)Click the Browse button to select a directory containing ZIP files.

3)Click Start Unzip and Delete to begin the extraction and deletion process. The application will provide updates in the output text    area.

Code Overview
The application consists of the following key functions:

*unzip_file(zip_file_path, output_folder, callback): Extracts a single ZIP file and calls a callback function upon completion or error.

*handle_unzip_with_timeout(zip_file_path, output_folder, timeout, text_widget): Manages the unzipping process with a timeout and updates the GUI with results.

*unzip_and_delete(zip_folder, text_widget, timeout=10): Finds and extracts all ZIP files in the selected folder, deleting them upon successful extraction.

*select_folder(): Opens a dialog for the user to select a folder.

*start_unzip_process(): Initiates the unzipping process based on the selected folder.

Notes
The application will inform users if a folder does not contain any ZIP files or if there are any errors during extraction.
The timeout for unzipping can be adjusted in the unzip_and_delete function by changing the timeout parameter.
